# ML-Based_MiningZones_Risk_prediction-Dashboard

A machine learning-powered web application to classify mining zones based on risk using environmental and operational data. The goal is to make mining risk predictions accessible and understandable through an interactive dashboard or script.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Mining operations face significant safety and environmental risks. This tool uses a trained machine learning model to predict risk levels for mining zones based on key factors such as NO₂ differential, water level, environmental stress, and proximity to forests. The model helps stakeholders prioritize interventions and improve safety.

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Final model:** Extra Trees Classifier with robust feature selection and scaling
- **Accuracy:** ~81%
- **Key Features Used:**
  - NO2_Differential
  - Environmental_Stress
  - WaterLevel_Mean
  - DistanceToForest
  - Water_Pollution_Interaction

  ## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for EDA and feature importance)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for training and evaluation)
- (Optional) Streamlit for web app deployment
